# ProjectsInDataScience
This folder is the compilation of work I did with Hannah Sonsalla for the Projects in Data Science class I audited at Macalester.  We scraped data from the tfrss track and cross country result website.  We grabbed cross country results from the last 5 years, spent a lot of time cleaning the data, built visuals, some models and a shiny app.  The shiny app includes some analysis, details on how we scraped data and interactive visuals. Check out the shiny app here, https://heatherlendway.shinyapps.io/miacShinyApp/ and browse all our code files.
